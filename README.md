# Breakfast at One Studios
## Who are you?
We are a small, upcoming game development studio focused on creating engaging and ingenuitive experiences for all audiences.
## What platforms do you use?
We currently use only Roblox but we plan to expand to other engines and platforms such as Unity games, hosted on itch.io and similar sites.
## What are you currently working on?
We are currently working on 2 Roblox games:
### Apple Tycoon
A fun tycoon designed for fun. A simple concept with satisfying graphics and audio design.
### Scopophobia
A horror game focusing on liminality as the main concept of fear. We focus on the sound design and a feel of realism to make the game hyper-realistic, enhancing the player's experience through fear.
Scopophobia is currently our **main** and most developed project.
## How can I support you?
You can support us by playing our games! Or if you wish, recommend our experiences to friends. If you want to go the extra mile, we [sell clothing on our Roblox group](https://www.roblox.com/groups/15817080/Breakfast-at-One-Studios#!/store)
